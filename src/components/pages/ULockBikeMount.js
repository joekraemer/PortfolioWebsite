    <h1> U-Lock Bike Mount </h1>
    <p> I designed and manufactured my very own custom lock mount. </p>

    <p> Once I bought a new bike, I decided to protect my investment with something a little more heavy duty than my old $5 cable lock from Wal-Mart.  So I purchased a hardened steel U-Lock.  I quickly found out that the U-Lock has no good place to go, unlike my old lock which I could wrap around the handle bars.  So the best spot is around the top tube and where it moves freely and somehow smashes against my knees with every pedal.  So I decided to fix it.

        I did some quick research on google and found that there is relatively few products out there.  Most use a series of velcro straps or some sort of pouch.  I wanted something stable and strong, yet quick and easy to remove.  

        Originally, I was going to use some sort of clasp, perhaps with some sort of snap-fit.  However, later in the day, I was inspired by the latch on our fence gate. This design would allow for quick one handed removal while keeping the lock secure (unless I were to flip over, but I think my lock falling off would be the least of my worries).

    <p> I had to use run through a couple iterations,  because I wasn't able to predict the shrinkage of the plastic in certain places, particularly the screw holes. </p>
