                <h3> After filming my life for 365 days, I created a video scrapbook of my Freshman year of college using shot one second videos. </h3>

                    <p>The first few days of college are a whirlwind of activities with meeting people and exploring new places and trying new things.  On my third day of college, I was talking with my new (and now good friend) Jack.  He showed me this YouTube video he had created just a year ago.  He was inspired by a man named Cesar Kuriyama who came up with the original idea. It was a series of 1 second videos all mashed up together.  Each video was taken on everyday of the previous year.  Each shot was a glimpse into his Senior year of high school.  His video was around 8 minutes long, but it took well over an hour to get through it.  We would pause the video and talk about a particular moment or for him to elaborate on a story. This was a great time for us to swap stories and have a great conversation. I loved how I felt like I just experienced the year as Jack, through ups and downs, from vacations to school, from summer to winter. I loved the idea and I started filming the very next day.</p>

                    <p>I knew that I was going to be showing this video to people and so at first I tried to only film cool things that were happening around me.  I would get slightly upset if I didn't film something interesting.  I wanted to have stories and interesting topics so I could have conversations like I did with Jack.  I filmed interesting clubs I tried out, sporting events I went to, cool chemistry experiments. After a month or so, I began to realize that my content wasn't a reflection of my life. Instead it was a superficial highlight reel.  I wanted this to be a reflection of me, not just the cool and interesting, but the whole story.  It was okay to take videos of the "mundane" because its what was really happening.  From then on, I tried to be more frank with my content and not only post the interesting parts of my day, but also the boring parts, such as studying or driving home.</p>

                    <p>At Christmas, the whole family gathered around the old projector and watched Super8 film from when my Dad and Aunts were kids.  It was so interesting to me to see daily life.  Not just the vacations to Niagara falls, but to see the big vintage station wagon, the flamboyant 70s decor, and my family being goofy.  I recognized that my video could be also a sort of time capsule, something that I will watch with my kids in 30 years and have to explain what a cell phone or how a human driven car worked.  </p>

                    <p>I know that you will not fully understand even 50% of the content if you are watching it without me.  All of the clips have stories behind them. Some of the clips have an obvious subject and message like the chants at a football game, or my dad spinning on a chair with a leaf blower.  Some are much less obvious.  Some hold meaning only to me. Nevertheless, the video is still entertaining and a great learning experience for me. Thanks for reading about my inspiration, motivation and thoughts on the project and I invite you to take a walk through my Freshman year at college.</p>
