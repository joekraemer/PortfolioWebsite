    <h1> Cryptocurrency Tracker </h1>
    <p> I wrote a python script to track cryptocurreny prices as well as the profitability of my personal mining rig. </p>

    During the Spring of 2017, I became fascinated with cryptocurrencies and blockchain technologies.  I was amazed at the novelty of the decentralized authority and the public ledger.  The more I learned about the technology, the more I wanted to get involved.  

    Towards the end of May, I decided that I was going to build a GPU mining rig to mine ether on the Ethereum network.  It seemed like a relatively safe investment because I could always resell or reuse the hardware once mining became unprofitable.

    I spent about two weeks scouring craigslist, eBay, and internet forms searching for the cheap and relatively power efficient RX400 series GPUs.  I acquired 3 GPUs, a multi PCIe slot motherboard, a processor, a beefy 1000 watt power supply and some cheap RAM for $650.

    When my dad found out how much money I had spent investing in a volatile market, he was very skeptical and wanted to see if it would end up being profitable overall.  

    Initially I created an excel workbook and I was logging the current prices and my ether production manually. This was a tedious task that I really wished I didn't have to do.  I started thinking to myself and I realized that this would be a perfect opportunity to use my newly acquired Python knowledge.

    I learned Python for a statistics and probability course that I took, and I really wanted to do something more with it.  I spent a lot of time learning about JSON and REST APIs.  I was fascinated that there were so many websites that allowed you to interact with them on such a simple level.  I quickly found websites that had APIs that I could access to track prices as well as the production of my mining rig.

    The final script accesses 4 different websites to obtain bitcoin and Ethereum prices, how much bitcoin, Ethereum and USD I have, as well as my projected profitability.  Then this data is saved into a csv file every hour.

    At the end of the summer I opened the csv in Excel and created a variety of graphs to show the results of my investment.  You can see the results below.

    My dad was happy to see that my investment was a success and I am excited to see how much more the cryptocurrency community will grow.
